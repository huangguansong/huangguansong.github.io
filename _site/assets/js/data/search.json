    "content": "DillingerThe Last Markdown Editor, Ever            [![N      Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)      Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.  Type some Markdown on the left  See HTML in the right  ✨Magic ✨Features  Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown  Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)  Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive  Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger  Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDFMarkdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventionsthat people naturally use in email.As John Gruber writes on the Markdown site  The overriding design goal for Markdown’sformatting syntax is to make it as readableas possible. The idea is that aMarkdown-formatted document should bepublishable as-is, as plain text, withoutlooking like it’s been marked up with tagsor formatting instructions.This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feelfor Markdown’s syntax, type some text into the left window andwatch the results in the right.TechDillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:  AngularJS - HTML enhanced for web apps!  Ace Editor - awesome web-based text editor  markdown-it - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.  Twitter Bootstrap - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps  node.js - evented I/O for the backend  Express - fast node.js network app framework @tjholowaychuk  Gulp - the streaming build system  Breakdance - HTMLto Markdown converter  jQuery - duhAnd of course Dillinger itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.InstallationDillinger requires Node.js v10+ to run.Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.cd dillingernpm inode appFor production environments…npm install --productionNODE_ENV=production node appPluginsDillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

Great!Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.First Tab:node appSecond Tab:gulp watch(optional) Third:karma testBuilding for sourceFor production release:gulp build --prodGenerating pre-built zip archives for distribution:gulp build dist --prodDockerDillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within theDockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile tobuild the image.cd dillingerdocker build -t &lt;youruser&gt;/dillinger:${package.json.version} .This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.Be sure to swap out ${package.json.version} with the actualversion of Dillinger.Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish onyour host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host toport 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger &lt;youruser&gt;/dillinger:${package.json.version}  Note: --capt-add=SYS-ADMIN is required for PDF rendering.Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address inyour preferred browser.127.0.0.1:8000LicenseMITFree Software, Hell Yeah!"
